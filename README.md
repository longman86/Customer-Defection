# Customer-Defection
A project for AISaturdays Lagos(Cohort 5)
Customer defection is the loss of clients or customers. Telephone service companies, ISPs, insurance firms, etc, often use customer defection analysis and rates as one of their key business metrics because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one.
Companies usually make a distinction between voluntary defection (churn) and involuntary defection (churn). Voluntary defection occurs due to a decision by the customer to switch to another company or service provider, involuntary defection occurs due to circumstances such as a customer's relocation to a long-term care facility, death, or the relocation to a distant location.

In this analysis, involuntary reasons for churn will be excluded from the analytical models. We will instead tend to concentrate on voluntary defection, because it typically occurs due to factors of the company-customer relationship which companies control, such as how billing interactions are handled or how after-sales help is provided.

Our team was presented with data from a telco company and tasked to analyse the data and gain insight into customer defection as-well-as develop a model that will predict the possibility of defection by any customer.

The DataSet did not come with a data dictionary, but we used general knowledge to interpret the columns and came up with this dictionary for the purpose of this project;
